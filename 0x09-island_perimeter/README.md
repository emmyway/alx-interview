# island_perimeter

#### The goal is to calculate the perimeter of a single island in a grid, where the grid is represented by a 2D array of integers. Understanding how to navigate and analyze 2D arrays and apply logical operations to determine the conditions for perimeter calculation is crucial for this task.

## Concepts Needed:
### 2D Arrays (Matrices):

  - Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
  - Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).
### Conditional Logic:

  - Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.
### Counting Techniques:

  - Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the islandâ€™s perimeter.
### Problem-Solving Strategies:

  - Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.
### Python Programming:

  - Nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
  - Conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.
